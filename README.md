# ESDE project

This is the exercise work project of Embedded Software Development Environments course. Application presents a simple home automation system. 
This project is done fully by me. I decided to work alone to get the best learning experience from this course.

Instructions

Open and build project using Android Studio. I had huge problems with the original emulator of the Android Studio which is why I have used Genymotion's emulator to test ja use my application. My application has been tested with following emulators:

Google Nexus 5 - Android version 5.0.0 - API 21
Google Galaxy Nexus - Android version 4.1.1 - API 16

Application has also been tested with tablet device:

Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - Android version 4.4.2 - API 19

I used test file (MessageTest.java) provided by the course wiki to test the messaging of my application.
